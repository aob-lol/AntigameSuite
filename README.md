# AntigameSuite
Graphics demos in Processing intended for play with game controller.

# Usage
This suite requires a game controller for use. Plug in / pair a controller. 

It also uses a webcam; if you don't have one built in to your computer, please plug one in. 

Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download). 

Clone this repository somewhere usable. 

Open AntigameSuite.pde in Processing. 

Run the sketch. 

# Known Bugs

GameControlPlus bundles jinput to handle controller events. Currently there is no version of jinput compiled for Apple Silicon, so Apple Silicon Macs will receive an error on launch. Currently I do not have a workaround for this.
